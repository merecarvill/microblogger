# Microblogging app

The app allows users to create an account and share short textual posts, twitter-style.

Try it live [here](https://railstutorial-microblogger.herokuapp.com/)! You can use login using *railstutorial@example.com*, pw: *foobar*, if you would like to skip account creation.

This is the culminating project of the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).
